"""Mapping from spaCy NER labels to KG class URIs.

The mapping is consulted by ``disambiguate()`` to filter candidates to those
whose ``rdf:type`` is compatible with the NER label that produced the span.

The starter ships two entries pre-filled. Extend the mapping to cover every
NER label that appears in ``data/dev.jsonl`` — missing rows silently force
NIL on otherwise resolvable spans (the TA Look-Fors call this out).
